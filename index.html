        <h1>Events</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.25em; background-color: #00000088;">Our goal is to have enough AMV content to host a event at <a href="https://www.narcon.se/" style="color: white;"><strong style="font-size: 1.25em;">NÃ¤rCon Summer</strong></a> this year, the largest anime
            and
            gaming convention in the Nordics. We're constantly working to expand our community and encourage to
            submit
            AMV content so that we can reach this goal together.</p>

    <div class="sec" id="workings" >
        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>Project AMV Overload is designed to bring together anime and electronic music in a seamless, synchronized experience. To make this possible, we've developed a special software that runs on a computer and is connected to a DJ mixer. Additionally, we have created a server software that runs on the DJ's computer and relays information from the mixer to the video playback software.</p>        
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Playing music and video in real-time during a live DJ performance is a complex task that requires the ability to bring in and combine music on the fly. The tracks also need to be played in the same tempo, or beats per minute (BPM). Normally on big stages, there is a time delay for the video, which is undesired and needs to be compensated for. Our software takes care of all of these challenges, allowing the DJ to focus on what they do best: creating a dynamic and engaging performance.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>The video playback software receives information from the DJ mixer about the current song name and elapsed time, and then it loads and plays the right AMV for the song in real-time, ensuring that the video and audio are perfectly synchronized. All of the AMV videos are stored on the computer, ready to be played at the touch of a button.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>With our software, the DJ has full control over the visual aspect of their performance, allowing them to create a truly immersive and unforgettable experience for their audience.</p>
